## 🔌 About Arduino

**Arduino** is an open-source electronics platform consisting of a **microcontroller board** and an **IDE**. It allows you to:

- **Quickly prototype** projects with sensors and actuators.
- **Read environmental data** (temperature, light, distance, etc.).
- **Control devices automatically** (LEDs, motors, buzzers).
- **Communicate** with other devices via Serial, GSM, or IoT protocols like MQTT.
- **Build automation foundations** for smart homes, robotics, and industrial systems.

Arduino bridges the **physical and digital worlds**, forming the **core of IoT systems**.

## 🌐 What is IoT?

The **Internet of Things (IoT)** is a network of devices that **sense, communicate, and act** on data via the internet. IoT enables:

- **Sensing** → Detecting environment changes.  
- **Processing** → Making decisions with microcontrollers.  
- **Actuating** → Controlling outputs like motors or LEDs.  
- **Communicating** → Sharing data via MQTT, GSM, or Serial.  

IoT allows **automation with minimal human intervention**, enabling smart homes, industrial monitoring, and robotics.
